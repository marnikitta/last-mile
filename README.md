The “Last mile” is your space for focusing on and progressing through a single task. Each space includes a
plain to-do list and a timer.
This is not a replacement for a full-fledged task tracker. It’s a tool for tackling one bite-sized task at
a time.

Spaces are ment to be temporary. Once you’re done with a task, delete the space and move on.
